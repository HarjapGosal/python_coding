# Exercise 3 - Python Basic Operators

# Store as a number a mathematical calculation that includes addition,
# subtraction, multiplication and division. Make sure to include
# at least 2 whole numbers and two decimal numbers. Output the value
calculation_result = 15.7 + 7 * 5.5 - 9 / 3
print("Calculation result " + str(calculation_result))

# Use the modulo operator to calculate and store the remainder of 553 % 6
# in a new variable and then output the value
remainder_by_modulo = 553 % 6
print("Remainder by modulo " + str(remainder_by_modulo))

# Store the answer of a squared power relationship and a cubed power
# relationship in variables and then output the values
number_squared = 13 ** 2
number_cubed = 13 ** 3
print("Squared value of the number 13 = " + str(number_squared))
print("Cubed value of the number 13 = " + str(number_cubed))

# Using the addition operator store two strings into a variable,
# concatenating them and output the value of this string variable.
my_string1 = "I live in"
my_string2 = "Canada."
final_string = my_string1 + " " + my_string2
print("Concatenated string = " + str(final_string))

# Create two lists with 5 elements each. join these two lists using
# the addition operator. Then, store the two lists in a third
# variable by joining these two lists using the addition operator.
# Finally output its value of this third variable.
my_list1 = [7, 11, 15, 19, 23]
my_list2 = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
final_list = my_list1 + my_list2
print("Final list = " + str(final_list))

# Using the multiplication operator output a repeating sequence.
# There is no need to use a variable here, simply use print function.
print("Harjap " * 3)
print([3, 5, 7, 9] * 5)
